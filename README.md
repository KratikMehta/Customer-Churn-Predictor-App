# Customer Churn Prediction App

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The goal is to identify customers who are likely to leave a service or subscription, allowing businesses to take proactive measures to retain them.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with exploratory data analysis and model training.
- `models/`: Saved models and related files.

## Features

- Simple and easy-to-understand implementation of ANN
- Examples of customer churn prediction
- Well-documented code with comments
- Jupyter notebooks for interactive learning

## Installation

To get started with the project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KratikMehta/Customer-Churn-Predictor-App.git
cd Customer-Churn-Predictor-App
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Explore the Jupyter notebooks provided in the `notebooks` directory to understand how ANNs work and how to use them for different tasks. You can run the notebooks using Jupyter:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
